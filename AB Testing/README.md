# A/B Testing
Testing changes related to the introduction of an improved recommendation system of an international online store. 
The changes that will be tested are: better conversion into product page views, instances of adding items to the shopping cart, and purchases. 
At each stage of the funnel product_page → product_cart → purchase, there will be at least a 10% increase.

## Goals:
- Find out if users will show better conversion at each of the stages of the funnel (at least a 10% increase)
- Provide recommendations
## Analysis steps:
- Studying the general information about users (events, dates, users, region) and A/B test results
- Data preprocessing (filtering and merging tables)
- Carrying out exploratory data analysis (studying the filtered data)
- Clients' behavior analysis
- Studying conversion at different funnel stages
- Evaluating the A/B test results
- Providing recommendations
